# üèõÔ∏è Enterprise Network Simulation Project

An extensive, real-world enterprise network simulation lab developed to reinforce practical skills in network architecture, infrastructure security, and service deployment. The lab reflects a multi-campus layout and addresses business needs for scalability, redundancy, and secure communication.

## üìò Lab Source
Developed under **GURUTECH NETWORKS**

## üß≠ Objectives

- Design and implement a hierarchical network topology: Core, Distribution, and Access layers  
- Deploy services in a fortified DMZ, including DHCP, DNS, FTP, WEB, Email, and SMTP  
- Ensure secure connectivity for branch users to access centralized resources  
- Achieve redundancy via dual ISPs (SEACOM & Safaricom), DHCP failover, EtherChannel, and HSRP  
- Secure network traffic using ACLs, static routing, and Cisco ASA Firewall configurations  
- Enable centralized wireless control, VoIP telephony, and remote administrative access via SSH  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

- **Platform:** Cisco Packet Tracer  
- **Routing Protocol:** Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)  
- **Switches:** Catalyst 3850 (48-port), Catalyst 2960 (48-port)  
- **Firewall:** Cisco ASA 5500-X Series  
- **Wireless:** Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC), Lightweight Access Points (LAPs)  
- **VoIP:** Cisco Voice Gateway, IP Phones  
- **Virtualization:** Two physical servers hosting multiple VMs for service deployment  
- **Security Features:** STP PortFast, BPDUguard, SSH ACLs, static addressing in server farm  
- **Link Aggregation:** EtherChannel via LACP  

## üåê IP Address Planning

| **Function**       | **IP Range**           |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Management Network | `192.168.10.0/24`      |
| WLAN               | `10.20.0.0/16`         |
| LAN                | `172.16.0.0/16`        |
| VoIP               | `172.30.0.0/16`        |
| DMZ                | `10.11.11.0/27`        |
| Public ISP 1       | `105.100.50.0/30`      |
| Public ISP 2       | `197.200.100.0/30`     |

## üß© Core Features

- Hierarchical topology with logical separation of traffic  
- VLAN IDs: `10` (Management), `20` (LAN), `50` (WLAN), `70` (VoIP), `199` (Blackhole for unused ports)  
- DHCP failover and dynamic IP provisioning  
- DNS, FTP, Email, and Web services in virtualized DMZ environment  
- VoIP communication across departments using IP phones and voice gateway  
- Wireless coverage via departmental LAPs managed by a central WLC  
- Cloud computing readiness for remote client access  

## üîê Security Measures

- Cisco ASA Firewall configured with security zones, static routes, and inspection policies  
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) restricting SSH access to senior admin systems  
- Password encryption, console and enable passwords, banner messages, and IP domain lookup disabled  
- BPDUguard and STP PortFast enabled for rapid switch port transitions and protection  
- Subnetting for precise IP allocation across departments  
- HSRP for load balancing and high availability of gateways

## ‚úÖ Final Validation

Comprehensive testing confirmed device communication, service reachability, protocol convergence, and redundancy effectiveness ‚Äî ensuring the simulated network meets business requirements and is future-proofed for scale and security.
